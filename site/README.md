JuMP website
===

The website must be generated by Jekyll. This will create a subdirectory
docs which contains the actual website.

Apart from a standard Jekyll installation, you will also need the Jekyll plugins
`jekyll-optional-front-matter` and `jekyll-relative-links`

We deviate slightly from the standard way Jekyll is used:

* No front matter is needed in the markdown files
* Every directory has a `_dir.yml` containing directory specific information, 
  for instance, to specify the menu for each page in that directory.
